This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is based on the official tutorial found in  [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

After the standard tutorial I have investigated react a bit more and added the inversify functionality to it alogn with the styled componet library to style the application.

Inversify has been used to create providers, another library I was reading about is Unstated (very interesting not only for the the injection) at this [Link](https://hmh.engineering/the-unstated-react-service-pattern-786ea6168d1d).

Another interesting article about IOC and why using it in React is at this link

[WHY USING IOC IN REACT (with redux)](https://medium.com/@magnusjt/inversion-of-control-and-di-in-reactjs-and-redux-35161fcef847).


React now support typescript officialy so I have decided to use it for this demo.

This is my very first app with this library so if you know any cool stuff to read about it happy to know :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
